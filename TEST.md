# Manual Testing Guide - Multi-Company System

Use this guide to verify the implementation of Phase 2 to Phase 7 on your local machine.

### NOTE
Since port 5173 is currently in use on your machine, Vite has started the development server at `http://localhost:5174/` (or `http://localhost:5173/` if port 5173 becomes free). You can use either port depending on which server you have active.
